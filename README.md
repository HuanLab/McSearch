# McSearch

McSearch is a program for automated metabolite annotation for LC-MS/MS data. It utilizes CSS algorithm, MCS library and biotransformation database, achieving metabolite annotation by the structural analogs of query compounds.

For McSearch, we provide both single search mode and batch search mode. We also provide a script for MCS library construction. Users can generate MCS library from your own tandem mass spectral database (in msp format).

Currently, you can get access to McSearch either by R or on website. (our website: cloudmetabolomics.ca/mcsearch)

For more details, please refer to user protocols.
